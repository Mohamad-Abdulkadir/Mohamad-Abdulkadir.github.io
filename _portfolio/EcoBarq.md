## Shell Eco-marathon Overview

[Shell Eco-marathon](https://www.shellecomarathon.com/about.html) is one of the worldâ€™s leading energy-efficiency engineering programmes for students. It aims to push the boundaries of what is technically possible and inspire young people to become leading scientists and engineers of future energy solutions.
The programme provides a platform for high school and university teams to explore every aspect of design and technology, using their Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) skills to build their own ultra-energy-efficient cars, and then take them out on the track in competition.
