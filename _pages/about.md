👨‍💻 I am a recent Computer Science graduate from the United Arab Emirates University, passionate about AI and machine learning.

# 💻 Professional Experience
-   **ML Research Intern @ ADIA Lab** 
    *   Developed a transformer‐based encoder to predict in-hospital mortality from 48x76 multivariate EHR time-series data, achieving high AUROC and Recall.
    *   Implemented attention and gradient-based methods to track feature importance.
    *   Built a ground-truth report generation pipeline that converts raw EHR sequences into structured text summaries and curates them using an LLM.
    *   Working on fine-tuning an LLM for clinical report generation and exploring alignment approaches to ensure factual grounding and accuracy.
-   **AI Intern @ e&** 
    *   Contributed to integrating an AI-powered content recommendation tool with the Starz On Business platform.
    *   Developed a bespoke chatbot for Starz On Business to automate tier-1 customer support cases using the platform's guides and FAQs.

# 👨‍🔬 Research Projects
- **United Arab Emirates University - SURE+ Grant**: Researched the use of artificial intelligence in task classification and allocation in mobile crowdsensing platforms. Developed techniques to generate synthetic training data for task classifiers and a fake task detection mechanism that involves a combination of machine learning models and filtering algorithms.
- **Advanced Technology Research Council - STEM Youth Mentorship Program**: Focused on non-stationary contextual-bandit algorithms and large language models (LLMs) for recommender systems. I worked on introducing change-point detectors to contextual bandit algorithms to enhance performance in stochastic environments and fine-tuning LLMs for recommendation tasks.
- **United Arab Emirates University - SURE+ Grant**: Contributed to developing an adaptive educational chatbot powered by artificial intelligence, actively participating in all project phases.

## 🤖 Open-Source Contributions
I have contributed to [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/), a leetcode-style open-source repository of problems focused on linear algebra, machine learning, and deep learning.
