👨‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate computer science student at United Arab Emirates University.

Currently, I'm working on research projects about mobile crowdsensing and recommender systems as well as completing the last semester of my undergraduate degree.

<!-- # Experience Overview -->

# 👨‍🔬 Research Experience
- **Student Researcher @ UAEU SURE+ Program**: Researching the use of artificial intelligence in task classification and allocation in mobile crowdsensing platforms. Developed techniques to generate synthetic training data for task classifiers
- **Student Researcher @ STEM Youth Mentorship Program**: Researching non-stationary contextual-bandit algorithm. Working on introducing change-point detectors to contextual-bandit algorithms to enhance in performance in stochastic environments (recommendation systems)
- **Student Researcher @ UAEU SURE+ Program**: Worked on developing an adaptive educational chatbot powered by artificial intelligence. Actively Participated in all project phases.

## 🤖 Open-Source Contributions
I have contributed to [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/), a leetcode-style open-source repository of problems focused on linear algebra, machine learning, and deep learning.
